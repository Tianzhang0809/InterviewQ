This folder contains the interview questions I have met during the job searching process - from 2013.12 - 2014.5. I have been through interviews from many famous/not-so-famous comanies. This was a precious experience for me. As a non-CS student learning coding, I learned a lot. 

Here I provide the question/my answer to the questions. Hopefully you can enjoy them and good luck!
